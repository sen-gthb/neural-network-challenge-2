# neural-network-challenge-2
In this challenge, a branched neural network is created to predict attrition, whether employees are likely to leave the company, in addition to the department that best fits each employee. Data is first preproccessed, then the model is created, compiled, trained, and evaluated. Completed in Google colab independently as well as with some assistance from an EdX tutor.
